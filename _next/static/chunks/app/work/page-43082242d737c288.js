The Challenge\n72 AI Labs was doing great automation work, but visually, they were just a name. They needed a brand that looked as professional as their code—clean, corporate, and distinct from the usual "blue brain" AI clich\xe9s. They wanted a full digital presence that they could show off immediately.\n\n### 2. The Concept\nThe number "72" holds cultural significance for the founders. We wanted to respect that heritage while keeping it relevant to tech.\n\nInstead of random shapes, we used **Islamic Geometry**. The result is the "Celestial Bloom"—a geometric star that also mirrors the nodes of a neural network.\n\n- **The Colors:** We swapped the standard tech blue for **Black, Gold, and White**.\n- **The Vibe:** Premium and established, not just another startup.\n\n### 3. The Execution\nWe took ownership of the entire build—from the logo design to the full website development.\n\nThe timeline was strict: they wanted to go live on the **Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday**. We didn\'t just meet the deadline; our team moved fast and delivered the fully finished site way ahead of schedule, giving them plenty of time to prepare for their launch.\n\n### 4. The Result\nThe rebrand gave them a legitimate face. It allowed them to expand their presence on LinkedIn and approach clients with much more confidence. They evolved from a "group of engineers" into a recognized brand.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **20+** Projects Delivered\n- **14+** Happy Clients\n- A consistent, professional digital presence.',galleryImages:["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1677442136019-21780ecad995?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1676299081847-824916de030a?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"],testimonials:[{content:"WaterPlane completely transformed our digital presence.

The Challenge\nPukaar is a women\'s safety startup with a diverse team, including a member currently studying at **IIT Kharagpur**. They had a critical funding pitch coming up on campus in just one week.\n\nThe problem? They had a great concept but no product. They needed to prove that their complex "Voice Activation" feature wasn\'t just theory—they needed a working prototype to show the panel.\n\n### 2. The Logic: Why Voice?\nThe core insight was simple: **In a panic situation, voice is faster than touch.** A victim might not have time to unlock her phone and dial. We needed a system that could listen for a distress trigger (like shouting) and instantly execute background tasks—sending GPS coordinates to family and police—without the user touching the screen.\n\n### 3. The Execution\nWe handled this entirely remotely. Working from our home setups, we synced online with the Pukaar team for a **7-Day Sprint**.\n\nIt was a crunch. We engineered the background voice-processing logic and designed a "Panic-Friendly" interface that was large and high-contrast. We focused strictly on functionality—ensuring the app responded instantly to voice triggers even when the phone was locked.\n\n### 4. The Result\nWe went from concept to code in a week.\n\n- **The Pitch:** The team walked into the IIT pitch with a live application.\n- **The Test:** The panel asked for a beta test phase to validate the app before potential incubation.\n- **The Deal:** Because we delivered under such tight pressure, WaterPlane moved from being just "help" to becoming an **equity partner** in the venture.',galleryImages:["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488521787991-ed7bbaae773c?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113598332-cd288d649433?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"],testimonials:[{content:"WaterPlane helped us reach thousands more people.

The Mission\nShakti Center hosts an annual event called \"Ghoshthi.\" It brings together top doctors and psychologists to help parents of children with physical and mental disabilities. The goal is simple but important. Parents get to ask experts personal questions on how to manage their child's behavior and needs.\n\nThey needed a team to manage the whole event. That meant handling the venue, the materials, and recording the session for people at home.\n\n### 2. The Work\nWe took charge of everything on the ground.\n\n- **Logistics:** We managed the venue and brought in the sound guys. We spent days gathering materials and even had to rush to the market to buy a lighting lamp just minutes before the event started.\n- **Tech & Visuals:** We designed the background visuals for the display screen. We also handled the photography and set up a YouTube livestream so parents who couldn't visit could still watch.\n\n### 3. The Reality Check\nThis was our first event at this scale and honestly, it was not perfect.\n\n- **The Issues:** The TV screen we rented for the backdrop malfunctioned. Later, some of the kids running around accidentally pulled out the streaming cables which stopped the live feed.\n- **The Fix:** We didn't make excuses or blame the TV vendor. We took the blame. We fixed the stream while the event was happening and managed the crowd so the doctors could keep talking to the parents without interruption.\n\n### 4. The Result\nEven with the technical issues, the event served its purpose. Parents got their answers and the experts were able to help. We also managed to record the session for their records.",galleryImages:["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599447421405-0c1741427447?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506126613408-eca07ce68773?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"],testimonials:[{content:"Peaceful and professional.",author:"Owner, Shakti",image:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552058544-f2b08422138a?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"}]},{slug:"priyanka-studio",title:"Priyanka Studio",category:"Visual Arts",author:"Vansh Dixit",date:"Dec 15, 2025",heroImage:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542038784424-48edbb3b5198?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop",content:'### 1. The Context\nPriyanka Studio was already a success story. As an established name in wedding photography and cinematography, they didn\'t have a "getting clients" problem; they had a "time" problem.\n\nThey were handling everything—shoots, heavy editing, client management, and trying to keep their social media alive. They needed a partner to take over the digital heavy lifting so they could focus purely on their craft.\n\n### 2. The Partnership\nThis is more than a client relationship; it’s a symbiotic ecosystem.\n\n- **The Exchange:** We leverage their high-end camera inventory for our premium shoots. In return, we became their digital operations team.\n- **The Strategy:** We didn\'t need to teach them how to create content—they are the pros. Our job was **curation and visibility**. We took over the post scheduling, grid layout design, and Google My Business management. We ensured that their beautiful edits were presented beautifully online, without them lifting a finger.\n\n### 3. The Result\nBy handing off the digital operations to WaterPlane, Priyanka Studio gained back hours every week. This allowed them to increase their delivery pace and focus on quality control.\n\n**The Metrics:**\n- **Google My Business:** Optimized their listing, resulting in a **40% increase** in search views and local inquiries.\n- **Visual Identity:** Transformed a scattered feed into a cohesive, premium digital portfolio that matches the quality of their cinematography.',galleryImages:["https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460661419201-fd4cecdf8a8b?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513364776144-60967b0f800f?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"],testimonials:[{content:"My work looks incredible here.",author:"Priyanka",image:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531746020798-e6953c6e8e04?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop"}]},{slug:"kunal-edits",title:"Kunal Edits",category:"Post-Production",author:"Vansh Dixit",date:"Dec 15, 2025",heroImage:"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574717436401-063851898909?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop",content:"### 1. The Context\nKunal is a college friend and easily one of the best video editors in Lucknow. He already had an amazing Instagram page showcasing his skills, but he wanted to level up. He needed a proper portfolio website to present his work to bigger clients professionally, beyond just an Instagram grid.\n\nWe didn't want to just \"sell\" him a website. We saw a chance to partner up.\n\n### 2. The Barter Deal\nWe made a deal that worked for both of us without money changing hands.\n\n- **Our Move:** We handled the tech. We designed and deployed a full portfolio website for him, giving him a professional domain to share.\n- **His Move:** In return, he edits 3 videos for our internal projects.\n\nIt’s a win-win. We gave him the platform; he gives us his skills.\n\n### 3. The Collaboration: IIT BHU (Kashiyatra 2025)\nThis partnership went into action during IIT BHU’s Kashiyatra 2025 event.\n\n- **The Job:** Kunal had to cover the event highlights and deliver reels.\n- **The Team:** One person can't shoot and edit everything alone. So, a WaterPlane member tagged along to handle the videography using high-end cameras we sourced from **Priyanka Studio** (another partner).\n- **The Result:** We shot the footage, and Kunal worked his magic on the edit.\n\n### 4.

The Context\nStitch & Soul is a new streetwear and gothic clothing startup based in Kolkata. They were just launching and initially came to us with a simple, transactional request: *"Can you handle our ads?"*\n\nWe could have just said yes and run some Facebook campaigns. But we saw a brand with a strong vibe that needed more than just ad spend—it needed a voice.\n\n### 2. The Shift: More Than Ads\nWe stepped in with a lot more than they asked for.\n\n- **Month 1:** We didn\'t just manage the ad budget. We designed high-quality mockups for their creatives, analyzed the performance data deeply, and gave them strategic insights on *why* certain things were working.\n- **The Vibe:** On paper, we were consultants. In reality, we treated their brand like it was our own. We realized that **Brand Making is fun for us.** We became part of their internal team, solving core problems during our meetings that went way beyond just "marketing."\n\n### 3. The Evolution\nThey saw the value immediately. After the first month, they didn\'t just renew; they evolved the relationship. They retained us specifically for **Strategic Consulting**.\n\n- **The Weekly Grind:** We now deliver weekly brand audits, competitor analysis, and SEO trends to keep them ahead of the curve.\n- **From Idea to Edit:** We started pitching Reel ideas with short storyboards. They loved them so much that we expanded them into full scripts. Now, they shoot the footage based on our direction, and **we handle the final edit** to ensure it hits the perfect gothic/streetwear aesthetic.\n\n### 4.
